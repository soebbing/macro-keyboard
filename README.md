# Macro Keyboard Code

This is a modified version of [Ryan Bates'](http://www.retrobuiltgames.com/the-build-page/macro-keyboard-v2-0/macro-keyboard-mini-v1-0/) code for his macro keyboard mini.

I just removed some (for me) unnecessary functionality and changed the button functions to suit my needs.

The current functionality is:

- Button 1: Open Kitty terminal
- Button 2: Mute/Unmute Google Meet
- Button 3: (nothing)
- Button 4: Move window up one workspace
- Button 5: Lock screen
- Button 6: Copy
- Button 7: Paste
- Button 8: Move window down one workspace
